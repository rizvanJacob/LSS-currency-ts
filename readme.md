## Development Approach and Details

This application implements basic Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) functions and was implemented using a model-view-controller architectural approach as described below. Our approach and timeline in developing this application was to:

#### Day 1

1. Set up server using express
2. Define all schema and generate PostgreSQL database using Prisma
3. Plan server routers for basic CRUD functions using REST conventions

#### Day 2

1. Authorisation via sgID client
2. Server routers and controllers to CRUD trainees and trainings
3. Front end client to CRUD trainees and trainings

#### Day 3

1. Server algorithm to track currencies and display currencies for trainee
2. Server algoritm to update currencies
3. Front end client for trainees to book and complete trainings

#### Day 4

1. Server routers and controllers to CRUD users
2. Front end client for users
3. Implement authentication across all application paths

#### Day 5

1. Deploy application
2. Style application

### _Model_

### _View_

The views and user interactions were developed using the react and react-router-dom libraries.

### _Controller_

There are four categories of controllers in the application: for trainees, trainings, and users, and authentication

The controllers for users, trainings and trainees allow basic CRUD functions for the User, Trainee and Trainings models. The routes for each of these functions adhere to REST conventions. The authentication controller functions as middleware to ensure only authorized users can access the respective functions.
